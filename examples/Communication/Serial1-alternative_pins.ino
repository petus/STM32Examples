/*
*  Serial1 with alternative pins example with Nucleo 64 STM32F411 which 
*  is supported in Arduino IDE by
*  www.github.com/stm32duino
*
*  Description:
*  Sends "Hello World" message through hardware alternative pins of Serial1  
*  Baudrate is 9600 Bd
*  Alternative pins are described in /core/variant/PeripheralPins.c
*
*  Connection:
*  Serial1 is alternatively connected to PB6 and PB7
*  TX - PB6 -> connect TX of STM32 to RX of USB-UART converter
*  RX - PB7 -> connect RX of STM32 to TX of USB-UART converter
*  GND to GND
*
* Define serial and RX, TX pins
* HardwareSerial Serial1(rx, tx);
* 
*  Made by http://stm32duino.eu (2018)

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup()

}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever

    Serial1.println("Hello World");
    // wait one second
